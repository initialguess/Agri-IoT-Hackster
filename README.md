# Agricultural IoT with the AVR64DD32 and the RN2xx3 LoRa Module
This project began as a Capstone project at Arizona State University in partnership with Microchip Technology. The goal was to create a cost-effective, low-power solution for a local community garden that wanted to monitor soil conditions throughout their plot. The growing beds were too spread out to benefit from wi-fi access and the sensor nodes needed to be battery-powered and long-lasting. Water conservation has become increasingly important for farms in this region, as more and more restrictions are enacted to protect the Colorado River Basin. This solution would need to help optimize irrigation schedules and take into account weather conditions as well as the soil's local variability.
